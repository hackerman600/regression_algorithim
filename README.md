# regression_algorithim
Linear regression algorithim from scratch, 99% accuracy, it was indended to be easy and quick which is why the bias term and test dataset was excluded. 
I implemented the partial derivative algorithim from scratch demonstrating my understanding of calculus with respect to machine learning.
